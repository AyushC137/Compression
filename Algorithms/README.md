This is my attempt on learning few basic lossless compression algorithms and combining them to achive best compression ratio in minimum time.
I tried to make code as efficint as I could so the huffman tree is a canonical huffman tree with base 2 encoding and Burrows Wheeler Transform uses suffex array and first-last column methods.
Best combination I could come up with is in Compressor.py so use it to compress and test files.
