Initially without looking into compression algorithms this was my failed attempt to think of something that is not possible,
I thought of thinking about a file as a huge integer(in this case I concatinate red channel of image) which then could be given to some predifined mathematical function 
to get a smaller number I thought of all possible functions and ended up with log10 as my final choice 
but soon enough I figured out that to get an exact number or even near to exact number of 'x' digits you require
x digit long decimal number.
