Initially without looking into compression algorithms this was my failed attempt to think of something that is what I am concluding not possible,
I thought of thinking a file as a huge integer(in this case I concatinate red channel of image) that could be given to some predifined mathematical function 
to get a smaller number I thought of all possible functions and ended up with log10 as my final choice 
but soon enough I figured out that to get an exact number or even near to exact number of 'x' digits you require
x digit long decimal number ,so then I tried some other mathematical functions and unconsciously ended up creating a binary converter where I stopped this project.
