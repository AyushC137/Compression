This is an attempt on the facinating idea of compressing data using psudo random number generator,
I am still searching ways to efficiently crack a prng  ,so this was also an attempt to understand them,
understanding working of mersenne twister was a bit hard , so in this case I tried to implement a brute force approach on  
red channel data of 16x16 photo using Linear congruential generator, but stopped as it would take ages with this approach to come to a nearly same result as the orignal data.
